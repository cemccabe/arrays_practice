##### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

* I feel 3/5 confident. I got a good grasp of the basics playing around with the 4 methods in the lesson, but it took me a fair amount of time to get comfortable with them.

##### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

* Not particularly. If the need does arise, I can always reference the documentation and play around with a new method in irb.

##### What questions do you have about Arrays?

* The only question I can think of is what happens to empty arrays? I assume they behave similarly to arrays with data added, but I can explore that as a technical challenge
